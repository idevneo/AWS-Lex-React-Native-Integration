# AWS-Lex & React-Native-Integration
Using AWS Lex for chatbot integration with a cross platform react native mobile application.

To run this demo first clone the repository.
Then cd into the project and type 'expo start'. This will open a site where you can choose to demo the app in 3 ways: Android emulator, iOS simulator, or just in the web browser.

This bot is very simple and generates a username from a string and number. To prompt the bot run type any of the following commands: create my username, create username, create a username, make my username, make username, make a username. 

Then provide it with a number and the bot returns your new username that is the string you provided combined with the number.

Followed this post to create the bare bones bot:
